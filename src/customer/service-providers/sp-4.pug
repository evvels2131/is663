                    About 70 bucks for a cracked iPhone 5s screen- dropped
                    it pretty bad on cement and the crack was ridiculous
                    but the phone was still fully functional. Decent price
                    compared to Apple repairs I bet.

                    Service was fine and quick which was great that day...
                    140$ for screen fix plus case ok cool I can deal. Except
                    a month later and realized whatever glue they used to hold
                    the new screen down isn't holding.. Shortly after dropped
                    phone w case and screen protector cracking the screen...not
                    the screen protecter...

                    Stan was very helpful, approachable, and quick! There's
                    a 90 day warranty with everything they fix too! We brought
                    in an ipad mini with a shattered screen and after they
                    replaced the screen, it looks as good as new! They also
                    offer great prices relative to other stores!

                  A typical repair job will involve us examining the
                  equipment and running a quick diagnostic on it.
                  Once we figure out what happened with the equipment,
                  we’ll tell you about the problem and also tell you
                  what would be necessary in order to fix it. If you
                  decide that it’s worth fixing, then we will fix it
                  for you.

                    About 70 bucks for a cracked iPhone 5s screen- dropped
                    it pretty bad on cement and the crack was ridiculous
                    but the phone was still fully functional. Decent price
                    compared to Apple repairs I bet.

                    Service was fine and quick which was great that day...
                    140$ for screen fix plus case ok cool I can deal. Except
                    a month later and realized whatever glue they used to hold
                    the new screen down isn't holding.. Shortly after dropped
                    phone w case and screen protector cracking the screen...not
                    the screen protecter...

                    less money than other local repair shops and they

                    Stan was very helpful, approachable, and quick! There's
                    a 90 day warranty with everything they fix too! We brought
                    in an ipad mini with a shattered screen and after they
                    replaced the screen, it looks as good as new! They also
                    offer great prices relative to other stores!
